# Creating-a-TIFF-stack-from-individual-TIFFS-in-python

Problem statement: 
* Images can be generated in PNG, JPG, or TIF file formats.
* Popular file formats like PNG and JPEG only allow three channels (RGB).
* For research work in deep learning, sometimes it is important to take more than three channels. To increase the channel from three to four, I created this repository to solve this problem.


## CODE

python tiff_stack.py
